# Abstract
Improve Autism Screening by creating predicting the likelihood of having this condition.

# About this dataset
What is Autism ?
Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication.

# Causes and Challenges
It is mostly influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Because autism is a spectrum disorder, each person with autism has a distinct set of strengths and challenges. The ways in which people with autism learn, think and problem-solve can range from highly skilled to severely challenged.
Research has made clear that high quality early intervention can improve learning, communication and social skills, as well as underlying brain development. Yet the diagnostic process can take several years.

# The Role of Machine Learning
This dataset is composed of survey results for more than 700 people who filled an app form. There are labels portraying whether the person received a diagnosis of autism, allowing machine learning models to predict the likelihood of having autism, therefore allowing healthcare professionals prioritize their resources.

REVA Academy for Corporate Excellence, RACE is an initiative of REVA University, which offers a range of specialized, techno-functional programs in emerging technologies, custom-designed for the learning needs of working professionals and organizations. RACE undertakes research and consulting projects in artificial intelligence and data science on social causes. One of the areas RACE researchers are working is on learning disabilities. Through this competition, we endeavor to create awareness among the data science community to develop an early detection system to prevent Autism.
